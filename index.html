        <p class="sectionTag text-big">Computer science</p>
        <p class="sectionSubTag">Computer science is the study of algorithmic processes, computational machines and computation itself.
            As a discipline, computer science spans a range of topics from theoretical studies of algorithms, computation and 
            information to the practical issues of implementing computational systems in hardware and software.
            Its fields can be divided into theoretical and practical disciplines. For example, the theory of computation concerns 
            abstract models of computation and general classes of problems that can be solved using them, while computer graphics
             or computational geometry emphasize more specific applications. Algorithms and data structures have been called the 
             heart of computer science. Programming language theory considers approaches to the description of computational
              processes, while computer programming involves the use of them to create complex systems. Computer architecture 
              describes construction of computer components and computer-operated equipment. Artificial intelligence aims to 
              synthesize goal-orientated processes such as problem-solving, decision-making, environmental adaptation, planning
               and learning found in humans and animals. A digital computer is capable of simulating various information processes.

        <p class="sectionTag text-big" >Graphic Designing</p>
        <p class="sectionSubTag">Graphic design is the profession and academic discipline whose activity consists in projecting
             visual communications intended to transmit specific messages to social groups, with specific objectives. Therefore,
              it is an interdisciplinary branch of design whose foundations and objectives revolve around the definition of
               problems and the determination of objectives for decision-making, through creativity, innovation and lateral thinking
                along with digital tools, transforming them for proper interpretation. This activity helps in the optimization of 
                graphic communications (see also communication design). It is also known as visual communication design, visual 
                design or editorial design. The role of the graphic designer in the communication process is that of encoder or 
                interpreter of the message. They work on the interpretation, ordering and presentation of visual messages. The 
                design work always starts from a client's demand, a demand that ends up being established linguistically, either
                 orally or in writing, that is, that graphic design transforms a linguistic message into a graphic manifestation.

        <p class="sectionTag text-big">Multi-Core Processor</p>
        <p class="sectionSubTag">A multi-core processor is a computer processor on a single integrated circuit with two or more
             separate processing units, called cores, each of which reads and executes program instructions. The instructions
              are ordinary CPU instructions (such as add, move data, and branch) but the single processor can run instructions on
               separate cores at the same time, increasing overall speed for programs that support multithreading or other parallel
                computing techniques. Manufacturers typically integrate the cores onto a single integrated circuit die (known as
                 a chip multiprocessor or CMP) or onto multiple dies in a single chip package. The microprocessors currently used in
                  almost all personal computers are multi-core.A multi-core processor implements multiprocessing in a single physical
                   package. Designers may couple cores in a multi-core device tightly or loosely. For example, cores may or may not
                    share caches, and they may implement message passing or shared-memory inter-core communication methods. Common
                     network topologies used to interconnect cores include bus, ring, two-dimensional mesh, and crossbar. Homogeneous
                      multi-core systems include only identical cores; heterogeneous multi-core systems have cores that are not 
                      identical.</p>
